Only implement features with use cases in apps being pushed to production.  Keep the\r\ncode clean, lean, and blazing fast.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* 100% declarative dsl - no javascript required\r\n* fixed headers\r\n* sortable headers\r\n* pass a model on the parent scope to filter data by\r\n* sorting tracks the state of ascending / descending on a per column basis\r\n* extremely easy to customize, just add your own html and css to the custom html tags.  it just works!\r\n* simple row selection.  just pass the name of a method on your controller scope, and the row will be passed in.\r\n* row even/odd coloring\r\n* rows are bound to a model, which is simply an array of your objects, allowing for simple customization \r\nand data loading\r\n* enable / disable sorting of columns\r\n* when the browser is resized or data is added / removed from the bound model, as scrollbars appear / disappear \r\nthe fixed header columns adjust their width to pixel perfection.\r\n* when the browser is resized or data is added / removed from the bound model, the height of the scrolling\r\ncontainer adjusts its height to pixel perfection, even if your container's height is specified in percentages.\r\n* does not require any dependencies other than stock angular.  no jquery needed.\r\n* simple.  only 400 lines of code.\r\n\r\nStyling the grid:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nYou can put your own classes and styles on any of the custom elements.\r\n\r\nSo for your example, if you want to use the bootstrap progress bar in one of your columns, on the:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<column>\r\n```\r\n\r\nelement you can just add the progress class to it directly like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<column class=\"progress\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also edit the angular-table.css file as needed, and/or inherit from its classes in your own css file.\r\n\r\nStyling the ascending / descending icons:\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* To use the default styling, ensure your header text is in an element with the style:  display: inline-block applied\r\nso that the icon and your header text aligns.\r\n* To customize the styling, remove or change the classes 'angularTableDefaultSortArrowAscending' and\r\n'angularTableDefaultSortArrowDescending' in angular-table.css.\r\n\r\nTemporary workaround to [issue 8](https://github.com/davidjnelson/angular-table/issues/8) (transcluded expressions not executing in parent scope)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nShould have this fixed in the near future, but in the meantime you can prepend \"parent.\" to any expression you want\r\nevalued in the parent scope, for example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\r\n<column><a href ng-click=\"parent.inParentScope(row)\">should call parent scope</a></column>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to use angular-table with jade templates:\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt will work, but you have to be very careful with the tabs.  Here is a working example:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/davidjnelson/angular-table/issues/18\r\n\r\nSupported browsers:\r\n-------------------\r\nAll modern browsers are supported: \r\n* Windows: Chrome latest, Firefox latest, Internet Explorer 9+\r\n* OSX: Chrome latest, Firefox latest, Safari Latest\r\n* IE8<, IOS 4<, and Android 3< are not currently supported since they don't support getComputedStyle.  The project I \r\nbuilt this for doesn't have to support IE8<, but if you do and want to add support, let me know.  This would be a \r\nfantastic pull request :-)\r\n\r\nRunning a local demo:\r\n---------------------\r\n* git clone https://github.com/davidjnelson/angular-table.git\r\n* cd angular-table\r\n* mvn jetty:run\r\n* visit http://localhost:8090 in your browser\r\n\r\nWhy Not Use ng-grid or smart table?\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile I deeply respect the work these folks have done, there were some issues I had that prevented me from using either.  \r\nI originally started with ng-grid, and really wanted to use it.\r\n\r\n**Smart Table**\r\n\r\n* My use case required fixed headers, and its lack of support for that was a deal breaker.\r\n\r\n**ng-grid**\r\n\r\n* No declarative configuration and customization.  You have to edit templates and options in javascript.\r\n* A serious, dealbreaker bug where the selected row changes when you sort the columns.  I filed the bug\r\nand after over a week no one working on it has responded.\r\n* A serious, dealbreaker design issue where the column used to house the scrollbar appears even if no scrollbar is present.\r\nI implemented a workaround by using a negative left margin for the content I needed to be flush to the right of the grid.\r\nThis sort of worked, but wasn't pixel perfect and felt hacky.\r\n* The code was too lengthy for my taste.  Weighing in at 3,400 lines, it supported a ton of \r\nfunctionality that I would never need.\r\n* It requires jquery.  I'm working hard to completely remove jquery from my app and this would be another\r\nspot requiring me to keep it.\r\n\r\nContributing And Feature Requests\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nI'd love to see both pull requests and feature requests come in.  Please make sure though that anything you send in uses a 100%\r\ndeclarative configuration, and is an actual use case you are using for a production app.  If there are not real \r\nuse cases for features, I won't add them.\r\n\r\nInteract\r\n--------\r\n\r\n**Discuss existing and create new potential-feature-discussion issues**\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at potential new features others have proposed and share your thoughts on them.\r\nAlso, please add new potential features that you need in your apps.
